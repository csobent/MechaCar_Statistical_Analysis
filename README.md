## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- **Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?** Vehicle length (value = 0.0000105 or 2.60e-12) and ground clearance (value = 0.00000184 or 5.21e-08) provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values. This is because they show having a significant impact on the mpg with their significance almost equal to zero.

- **Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?** The slope of this linear model is not considered zero. 
- **Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**
